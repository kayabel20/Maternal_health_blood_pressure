# Maternal_health_blood_pressure
Pregnancy and delivery-related issues are women's most common cause of death globally (World Health Organization, 2019). Maternal health is a crucial topic for healthcare providers to concentrate on because there is a need to detect potential risk factors for problems during pregnancy.

This report analyses a maternal health dataset to identify potential risk factors for pregnancy problems. It includes physiological measurements like Age, blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature, heart rate, and risk level. The report aims to answer questions regarding the distribution of variables, relationships between variables, and predicting the risk level during pregnancy.
